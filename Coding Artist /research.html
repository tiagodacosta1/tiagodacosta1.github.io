    <h1>A systematic approach to bow division and the compromises inherent to it</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>According to existing literature, there have been few developments in advancing bowing techniques since the
      early twentieth century. (Stowell, 1992) (Hodgson, 1941) In a comprehensive review conducted in 2002, Kennell
      acknowledged the growing interest in applying systematic research tools to studio instruction in music education
      research.
      (Kennell, 2002) However, there has been no research addressing how to distribute the bow or divide it according
      to note values while maintaining symmetry. This is a significant disadvantage for stringed musicians, and it is
      surprising that this area has received little attention in the literature.</p>

    <p>Classical musicians today are taught in much the same way as they were 200 years ago, which is unlike elite
      sports where new developments are constantly emerging. (Visentin, 2015) Recent research, such as Schoonderwaldt
      (2019),
      is complex and incorporates several variables simultaneously, making it difficult to understand the physical
      motions of the bow and the physics of bow-string interaction. A fundamental variable that is often overlooked is
      bow speed,
      which is the time it takes to cover specific distances in the bow while matching rhythmic values.</p>
    <p>This paper presents a mathematical approach to clear up the confusion surrounding other variables. (Figure 1)
      Only after understanding this mathematical approach can we analyze the physical side (i.e., the parts of the arm
      responsible for motions) where extensive literature exists from the past 200 years (Galamian, 1962; Flesch,
      1939; Auer, 1921; Joachim, 2006; Thistleton, 2012; Fischer, 2007).</p>

    <p>None of the research to date has addressed the time-dependent analysis of the
      right hand and the use of bow distribution as a fundamental variable for security in playing. (Figure 2)</p>

      </figure>
    </div>

   
    <p>Figure 2 demonstrates how the search for tone production should happen. By the end of this paper, it will be
      evident that bow distribution is the basis for determining all other variables inherent to the right hand, such
      as
      pressure and contact point. (Fischer, 2017)</p>
    <p>The motivation for this research comes from a desire to create a system that would enable string musicians,
      especially violinists, to develop their right hand. Our aim is to create a better understanding of how to have a
      diverse palette of colors using fixed parameters such as pressure, bow speed, and contact points. (Fischer,
      2007) We
      want to understand how these variables correlate and how independent they are from each other. Our goal is to
      create
      a notated system, like the one used for shifting, where one number corresponds to a finger. This formula will
      make
      it easier for stringed instrumentalists to produce a consistent sound and trust their practice more.</p>
    <p>The desire to create a secure performance led to the realization that often when practicing in sections, we are
      not
      always precise about where we are in the bow when playing the piece in full performance. Not knowing the bow's
      position results in many inconsistencies while performing, which are more pronounced during practice. After
      reading
      numerous pieces of literature on bow technique, we ended up with information on pressure, point of contact, and
      speed. Our question was how to measure them. For example, how many layers are there to bow pressure?</p>
    <p>This research addresses the absence of academic research on the analysis of violin bowing by implementing
      hypothetical examples if one applied the systems from the violin literature related to bowing and note values
      and by
      implementing original systematic models taken by examining renowned violinists. Our theoretical approach does
      not
      involve understanding motor control qualities governing strength and balance (gross motor control) or the subtle
      movements associated with biofeedback responses (fine motor control). Instead, we utilize a mathematical basis
      for
      bow distribution that will enable string musicians, especially violinists, to develop their right hand and
      produce a
      diverse palette of colors using fixed parameters such as pressure, bow speed, and bow division. By understanding
      how
      these parameters correlate with each other and how independent they are, we can create a notated system that
      makes
      it easier for stringed instrumentalists to consistently produce a sound they like and trust their practice more.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, our approach aims to eliminate the confusion that arises when attempting to measure the bow's
      speed or
      assuming that it is unnecessary to do so because there are too many variables inherent to it. We propose a
      time-dependent analysis of the right hand, questioning whether one can use bow distribution as a primordial
      variable
      for security in playing. Our research implements hypothetical examples by applying the systems from violin
      literature related to bowing and note values and examining renowned violinists' systematic models.</p>
    <p>Overall, this paper serves as a call for more academic research on the analysis of violin bowing and provides a
      theoretical approach to enhance the bowing technique. By understanding the mathematical basis for bow
      distribution
      and how it correlates with other variables, string musicians can develop a consistent and reliable sound,
      leading to
      more secure performances.</p>



    <h2>Rationale for Adopting a Systematic Approach and Prioritizing Bow Division Parameters</h2>
    <p>As a violinist, I have spent the past decade trying to synthesize the mechanics and science behind various
      techniques to better understand their underlying principles. While there is a wealth of knowledge and experience
      documented in violin literature, much of it is subjective and opinion based. Nonetheless, I find it inspiring
      and it
      piques my curiosity.</p>
    <p>I have focused extensively on the left hand and the mechanics of shifting on the violin. One aspect that has
      always
      perplexed me is the concept of making shifts "unnoticeable" and "inaudible". A shift cannot happen
      instantaneously
      and instead occurs over a specific part of the bow and during a note. This raises the question of where and
      which
      variables are involved in the bow.</p>
    <p>Some violin literature suggests reducing the pressure in the bow or slowing down the speed to hide the
      glissando.
      However, this can result in a disruption in the sound. The challenge lies in managing the three variables of
      tone
      production - speed, point of contact, and pressure - each of which has its own inherent variables. For instance,
      speed is calculated by dividing distance by time, but determining the ideal point of contact or measuring
      pressure
      is less straightforward.</p>
    <p>To simplify matters, I sought a straightforward concept that would explain how musicians can use their bows
      better.
      However, I needed to first understand how to measure each variable, even if not precisely. I found that there
      are
      only a few degrees of pressure that can be applied to the bow before the sound quality is compromised.
      Similarly,
      there are only five contact points, with two specific techniques (Sul Tasto and Sul Ponticello) that are not
      frequently used in the standard violin repertoire.</p>
    <p>The most challenging variable to measure was speed. While distance and time are relatively straightforward to
      measure, thinking in terms of relationality did not occur to me logically. I initially struggled to find
      consistency
      in dividing the bow into as many parts as needed to fit all the other variables. However, I later discovered
      that
      only a small number of equal bow divisions is necessary and practical.</p>
    <p>To determine the amount of bow used, I realized that I could use relationality and relate it to the rhythm of
      the
      music being played. This is explained by Joaquin in his book "The Technique of Violin Playing â€“ The Joachim
      Method"
      (Section VIII - Divisions of the Stroke). Joaquin establishes that several strokes of equal duration require
      equal
      bow lengths to achieve equality of tone-power, whereas irregular strokes need to conform to the duration of the
      notes.</p>
    <p>Joaquin provides an example of a hymn composed of whole, half, and quarter notes, where the whole notes receive
      the
      entire bow, the half notes half of the bow, and the quarter notes one-quarter of the bow. He explains that
      rapidity
      of stroke and increased pressure excite the strings to more violent vibrations and hence louder tones.</p>
    <p>However, this belief of increasing the bow's speed to increase the dynamic contrasts with the Capet method,
      where
      "gradation in dynamics comes from the pressure of the fingers on the stick, horizontal movement, and rarely
      through
      the bow's speed on the string". Both Joaquin and Capet agree that there should be a relationship between the
      note
      values and the amount of bow used. The difference lies in the approach to changing the amplitude of the notes.
    </p>
    <p>Joaquin believes that the bow division should change, while Capet maintains that the speed should remain the
      same.
    <p>For Allegro movements, Joaquin suggests using the same approach of dividing the bow according to note value but
      does not provide detailed bow distribution. He only mentions the involvement of the wrist for this type of speed
      (wrist-stroke).</p>
    <p>I later analysed the video recording hoping with the video recordings that I would be able to notate a score
      using
      the Capet system exactly "where compromises can be applied." In Chapter VII of "Modern Violin technique - How I
      teach and how to acquire it" by Frank Thistleton combines the duration of note with the length of the bow. This
      idea
      resembles Joaquim's approach: They divide the bow into semiquavers, minims, and semibreves. However, Thistleton
      does
      not explain the length to be used, only that a longer length is necessary for each longer value. Thistleton also
      explains which parts of the arm come into play.</p>
    <p>When Thistleton explains how to obtain gradations of tone, it contrasts with Joaquim because, for Thistleton,
      gradation of dynamics depends on the placement of the bow between the bridge and the fingerboard - "The five
      sounding points" by Simon Fischer.</p>
    <p>Thistleton mentions that for piano passages, the bow should move away from the bridge, almost over the end of
      the
      fingerboard, while to obtain a forte, it should be near the bridge. For mezzo-forte passages, the bow remains
      almost
      precisely between the bridge and the end of the fingerboard. Thistleton does not mention the increase or
      decrease of
      the bow's speed.</p>
    <p>One author that disagrees with Capet and Joaquim is Raphael Bronstein. ("Bronstein, 2016"). Bronstein affirms
      that
      it is necessary to vary the speed of the motion in various parts of the bow to maintain an even sound in a slow
      single bow stroke. He explains it as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Whenever there is more vertical pressure on the string from the natural weight of the bow, it must be
        compensated for with faster motion, as in the lower part, where the motion should be fast with little pressure
        from the forearm. In the middle of the bow, slow the motion and gradually speed up as you approach the tip,
        adding
        weight to compensate for the lack of the natural bow weight. This ratio remains the same in the up-bow
        motion."
      </p>
    </blockquote>


    <h2>Capet's Bow Division System for Achieving Symmetry in Bowing</h2>

    <p>In the context of exploring Mozart's sense of symmetry, Bronstein highlighted the importance of an
      architectural
      and spatial approach in bowing, which involves disciplined control of the stroke's speed and space to create
      contrasting planes. This quotation plays a vital role in framing an exploration that aims to achieve symmetry in
      the
      spatial action of the bow through the disciplined use of space and speed of the stroke.</p>
    <p>One of Capet's most significant contributions was the development of a notation system for dividing the bow
      into
      multiple equal parts, which could be up to eight parts, depending on the number of notes in one bow. This system
      demands a high level of training to master and involves labelling the multiple parts of the bow using letters
      and
      numbers.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in Figure 3, letter A corresponds to the use of the whole bow, letter B for half bow parts,
      letter C
      for quarter bow parts, letter D for eighth bow parts, and letter E for third bow parts. One advantage of Capet's
      bowing division system is the ability to accurately mark the appropriate bowing onto the score for further
      study.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, this system has enabled violinists to achieve precise control of the bow's length and would contribute
      to
      the creation of symmetrical and harmonious sounds in Mozart's compositions.</p>

    <h2>Analysis of Recordings and Embodiment</h2>
    <p>In order to determine if there was any symmetry to the bowing in the first movement of Mozart's D major violin
      concerto, an application of Capet's system was used. However, a reliable recording was necessary for analysis,
      and
      the recording from Roberta Verna, the concertmaster of the Copenhagen Philharmonic, was chosen.</p>
    <p>To test Capet's system, Roberta's recording was overlapped with the rule provided by Capet, which is to "divide
      the
      bow into as many equal parts as there are notes on one bow." The first note of the movement is an appoggiatura,
      and
      it must be determined whether note E is on the offbeat or not, as this will make it easier to analyze Capet's
      system.</p>
    <p>To prove Capet's system, Roberta would need to use divisions C0 to C4. The first semiquaver (appoggiatura)
      would
      occupy the distance between D0 and D1, while the other three would occupy the space between D1 and D4. The
      second
      beat is the inversion of the first beat, and the same principle applies, with the quaver occupying three-fourths
      of
      the entire bow and the remaining semiquaver responsible for the distance between C1 and C0.</p>
    <p>Although the bow divisions for the first half of the bar were determined, it was found that they were not
      practical, especially given the tempo marking of Allegro (around 120 bpm). Dividing the bow into halves,
      quarters,
      and fourths based on note values is unreliable and does not guarantee the necessary speed for the passage.
      Additionally, using Capet's rule of dividing the bow into as many equal parts as there are notes on one bow
      results
      in playing each beginning of each note either at the tip or at the frog, which is inefficient.</p>
    <p>To further analyze the recording, it was notated, and it was observed that the first beat of the bar is
      responsible
      for half of the bow used. This led to the hypothesis that Capet's system was in place but using eight equal
      parts,
      where each semiquaver corresponds to each division. In other words, there are eight quavers to a bow. The first
      note
      covers the distance from D0 to D1, and the remaining semiquavers of the beat cover the distance between D1 and
      D4,
      performed on a down bow.</p>
    <p>As for the second beat, the dotted semiquaver is responsible for starting on division D4 and ending on division
      D1.
      The remaining semiquaver corresponds to the distance covered from D1 to D0. The third beat of the bar
      corresponds
      from D0 to D4.</p>
    <p>It was also observed that while playing this bar, Roberta lifts the bow off the string while playing some of
      the
      notes. This lift happens on the third semiquaver of the second beat. This is necessary to give a clear beginning
      to
      the previous note of the beat and ensure that the last semiquaver sounds clear and separated from the dotted
      quaver.
      This lift of the bow does not happen in the first beat of the bar because there are two notes, and the change of
      notes makes the rhythm clear.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, while Capet's system provided some insight into the bowing of the movement, it was not practical
      for
      this particular passage. Further analysis and hypotheses were needed to determine the precise bow divisions used
      by
      Roberta Verna in her recording.</p>

    <h2>Exploring Bow Distribution in Schumann's A Minor Sonata and compromises regarding bow distribution</h2>

    <p>The first movement of Schumann's A minor sonata is written in 6/8 time signature, indicating six quavers in
      each
      bar. At first, I attempted to divide the bow into six equal parts, with each part playing a quaver. However, I
      soon
      realized this was impractical and uncomfortable. Even after determining each bow division and reaching the end
      of
      the fourth bar, there was no bow left. For instance, if we start the piece on division F6, we will reach the
      first
      beat of the first bar on division F2. The bar consists of six slurred quavers, but we need six divisions left,
      whereas we only have four left.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I attempted to divide the bow into eight equal parts, hoping to achieve symmetry. While the tone was
      significantly better, there was still a shortage of bow. So I listened to Augustin Hadelich's recording and
      found
      that he started in division D7, where the bow offers less resistance and is an ideal starting point.</p>
    <p>Augustin also used more bow on the third beat of the second bar, and upon analyzing, I found that he had
      doubled
      the bow. This compromise helped him to reach the B natural in the fourth bar with enough bow to cover the entire
      slur. Similarly, he doubled the speed for the F and E notes in the second bar as they restate the second and
      third
      notes of the first bar and require more strength.</p>
    <p>Even after analyzing the entire phrase, the only issue that remains is running out of bow on the last note. One
      can
      solve this by dividing the slur on the accented F or playing the last quaver and dotted minim on a new bow,
      providing the quaver with a clear and accented beginning.</p>
    <p>However, even when dividing the bow on the F, one still runs out of bow. This can be solved by playing it using
      half the bow as before. Although thinking in sixteen equal parts is complex and impractical, one can divide
      eight
      equal parts into halves, for example, for the last note, and think of it ending on division D 5.5.</p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, bow speed is independent of pressure and contact point, which only enhance the nuances of
      the
      music. In the first bar of the sonata, there is a piano marking followed by a crescendo to sforzando and another
      decrescendo, yet the bow speed remains constant.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, a time-dependent analysis of the right hand has confirmed that bow distribution is a crucial
      variable for security in playing. Pressure and contact point only add nuances to the music, and one achieves a
      color
      palette of sound by defining the speed and then applying certain degrees of pressure and contact point.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To further analyze the recording, it was notated, and it was observed that the first beat of the bar is
      responsible
      for half of the bow used. This led to the hypothesis that Capet's system was in place but using eight equal
      parts,
      where each semiquaver corresponds to each division. In other words, there are eight quavers to a bow. The first
      note
      covers the distance from D0 to D1, and the remaining semiquavers of the beat cover the distance between D1 and
      D4,
      performed on a down bow.</p>
    <p>As for the second beat, the dotted semiquaver is responsible for starting on division D4 and ending on division
      D1.
      The remaining semiquaver corresponds to the distance covered from D1 to D0. The third beat of the bar
      corresponds
      from D0 to D4.</p>
    <p>It was also observed that while playing this bar, Roberta lifts the bow off the string while playing some of
      the
      notes. This lift happens on the third semiquaver of the second beat. This is necessary to give a clear beginning
      to
      the previous note of the beat and ensure that the last semiquaver sounds clear and separated from the dotted
      quaver.
      This lift of the bow does not happen in the first beat of the bar because there are two notes, and the change of
      notes makes the rhythm clear.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, while Capet's system provided some insight into the bowing of the movement, it was not practical
      for
      this particular passage. Further analysis and hypotheses were needed to determine the precise bow divisions used
      by
      Roberta Verna in her recording.</p>
