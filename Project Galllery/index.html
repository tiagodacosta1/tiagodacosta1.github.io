      <p class="project-description">This project showcases the research I conducted at the Guildhall School of Music
        and Drama, where I aimed to find symmetry in the way violinists use their bows. I took inspiration from Capet's
        method, which was a pioneer in exploring bow symmetry and divisions, and demonstrated how pressure and contact
        points can be dissociated from speed through the use of symmetrical bow divisions. Through my research, I
        explored specific aspects of violin bowing and gained insights into how musicians can improve their technique.

      <p class="project-description">I created a user interface using HTML and JavaScript to display and manipulate data
        from a provided object. I opted for a simple design to focus on functionality. The interface allowed users to
        sort movies by year and add new movies to the object. This project helped me improve my skills in HTML,
        JavaScript, and DOM manipulation while creating a user-friendly interface.

      <p class="project-description">This project reflects my desire to pursue a career in web development and tells a
        bit about me as a person - a classical musician and hopefully, a web developer. Through this project, I gained a
        deeper understanding of and was able to apply concepts such as the use of Semantic HTML5 elements, CSS grid, DOM
        event listeners for user interaction and DOM updates in response to user interaction.

        By incorporating these concepts into my project, I was able to create a user interface that was both visually
        appealing and highly functional.

      <h3>Game</h3>

      <p class="project-description">
        I created a musical instrument matching game with 12 tiles where users have to match the instruments. When the
        user finds a correct match, a sound is played. Once all the tiles have been flipped and matched, the game ends.
